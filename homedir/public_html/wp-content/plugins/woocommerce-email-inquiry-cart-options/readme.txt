* Fix - Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.

This was causing a -1 to show when email pop-up form is called. wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https: but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly.

= 1.0.1 - 2013/03/14 =
* Fix - Can't activate the plugin on some sites . The problem was in php configuration differences .It was caused by php configuration related to short <?php syntax which allows to use <? instead.
